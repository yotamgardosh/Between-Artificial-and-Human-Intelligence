# Between-Artificial-and-Human-Intelligence

This repository contains materials and projects related to the course "Between-Artificial-and-Human-Intelligence". The course explores the intersection of cognitive science and artificial intelligence in understanding how language is acquired, processed, and represented both in the human brain and in AI systems.

## Course Description

This course offers a multidisciplinary perspective on language acquisition, bringing together insights from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. It examines the historical debates on language learning mechanisms, the computational models simulating the process, and the current applications of deep learning in natural language processing (NLP).

## Topics Covered

- Historical perspectives on language acquisition
- Introduction to natural language processing (NLP)
- Understanding word embeddings and their arithmetic properties
- Training and fine-tuning language models like GPT-2
- Exploring the functionality of large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities
- Cross-modality and multimodal models, with a focus on models like WHISPER
- Analysis of speech and language embeddings and their alignment with neural activity
- In-context learning versus plasticity-based approaches in AI
- Hands-on workshops integrating cognitive psychology with advanced AI models

## Projects

This repository includes Jupyter notebooks, data files, and reference materials for the following projects:

- Project 1: Language Model Analysis
  Examining how large language models capture spontaneous speech and its neural correlates.

- Project 2: Multimodal Learning
  Investigating the capabilities of multimodal models in understanding and processing human-centric concepts.

- Project 3: In-Context Learning
  Analyzing the potential of in-context learning to capture complex cognitive patterns without model retraining.

## Tools and Libraries

Throughout the course, we have utilized various tools and libraries, including:

- [Hugging Face's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- [OpenAI's GPT models](https://openai.com/)
- [WHISPER](https://openai.com/research/whisper)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Usage

To run the notebooks, start JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook in the project directory.

```bash
jupyter lab
```

OR

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the desired project folder and open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) to view the materials.
